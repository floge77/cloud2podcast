# Could2Podcast

**deprecated** Use [PodcastMaker](https://github.com/floge77/PodcastMaker) instead!

## Development

Run Server:

```shell
./startLocal.sh
```

On branch develop the Frontend is built and served with static files which is way friendlier for my Raspberry Pi Zero.
On branch master a beautiful Frontend will be created with the help of react and Chakra.
